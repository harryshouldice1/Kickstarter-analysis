# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to get comfortable looking at data and deriving conclusions based on that data.  Using the charts helped visualize what exactly I was doing with the data.
## Analysis and Challenges
Theater outcomes were more successful than plays based on the goals set.  Some challenges included using the countifs formula properly to extract the data from the kickstarter sheet and formating it correctly to match the proper goal.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The most sucessful month for theaters was in may.  Seasons affect how sucessful the theaters are. A launch date in spring or summer is more sucessful than a launch date in fall or winter.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Generally, the proportion of failed projects increased as the goal increased.  There were many more successful plays in the 1000 to 4999 range.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
A challenge would be coming up with a way to increase the number of success in the Fall and Winter.  What should be done to increase sucess when the goal is high?
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Launch dates are most sucessful in may and arer generally most sucessful in warmer times of the year.  There were always more sucessful launch dates than failed launch dates.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The percentage successful was significantly higher than the percentage failed when the goal was less than 10000.  The total projects in the higher goal rnages needs to be higher to get a more accurate conclusion.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The total number of plays that have a high goal is small.  
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A bar graph can display the number of sucessful and failed theater launch dates per month. Pie charts can be used to display the percentages for each goal range.
